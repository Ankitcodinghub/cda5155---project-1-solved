In this project you will create a simple MIPS simulator which will perform the following two tasks. Please develop your project in one (C, C++, Java or Python) source file to avoid the stress of combining multiple files before submission and making sure it still works correctly.

‚Ä¢ Load a specified MIPS text file1 and generate the assembly code equivalent to the input file (disassembler). Please see the sample input file and disassembly output in the project assignment.

‚Ä¢ Generate the instruction-by-instruction simulation of the MIPS code (simulator). It should also produce/print the contents of registers and data memories after execution of each instruction. Please see the sample simulation output file in the project assignment.

You do not have to implement any exception or interrupt handling for this project. We will use only valid testcases that will not create any exceptions. Please go through this document first, and then view the sample input/output files in the project assignment, before you start implementing the project.

Instructions

For reference, please use the MIPS Instruction Set Architecture PDF (available from the project1 assignment) to see the format for each instruction and pay attention to the following changes.

Your disassembler &amp; simulator need to support the three categories of instructions shown in Figure 1.

Category-1 Category-2 Category-3

J, BEQ, BNE, BGTZ, SW, LW, BREAK ADD, SUB, AND, OR, SRL, SRA,

MUL ADDI, ANDI, ORI

Figure 1: Three categories of instructions

000 Opcode (3 bits) Same as MIPS instruction

Figure 2: Format of Instructions in Category-1

Please pay attention to the exact description of instruction formats and its interpretation in MIPS instruction set manual. For example, in case of J instruction, the 26 bit instruction_index is shifted left by two bits (padded with 00 at LSB side) and then the leftmost (MSB side) four bits of the delay slot

1 This is a text file consisting of 0/1‚Äôs (not a binary file). See the sample input file sample.txt in the project1 assignment.

Instruction Opcode

J 000

BEQ 001

BNE 010

BGTZ 011

SW 100

LW 101

BREAK 110

Figure 3: Opcode for Category-1 instructions

If the instruction belongs to Category-2 which has the form ‚Äúdest ‚Üê src1 op src2‚Äù, the first three bits (leftmost three bits) are always ‚Äú001‚Äù as shown in Figure 4. Then the following 5 bits serve as dest.

The next 5 bits for src 1, followed by 5 bits for src2. The src1 is always register but src2 can be register (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, MUL) or immediate (SRL, SRA) depending on the opcode. The remaining bits are all 0‚Äôs. The three-bit opcodes are listed in Figure 5.

001 opcode (3 bits) dest (5 bits) src1 (5 bits) src2 (5 bits) 00000000000

ADD 000

SUB 001

AND 010

OR 011

SRL 100

SRA 101

MUL 110

Figure 5: Opcode for Category-2 instructions

If the instruction belongs to Category-3 which has the form ‚Äúdest ‚Üê src1 op immediate_value‚Äù, the first three bits (leftmost three bits) are always ‚Äú010‚Äù. Then 3 bits for opcode as indicated in Figure 6. The subsequent 5 bits serve as dest followed by 5 bits for src1. The second source operand is immediate 16-bit value. The instruction format is shown in Figure 7.

ADDI 000

ANDI 001

ORI 010

All signed numbers should be interpreted using 2‚Äôs complement arithmetic. Note that the signed numbers can be in registers, data memories or inside an instruction (e.g., the immediate field is signed for ADDI). Most importantly, each location (register or data memory) can be treated differently based on the context. For example, an arithmetic instruction (e.g., ADD) will treat the content of a register as a signed number (in 2‚Äôs complement arithmetic), whereas a logical operation (e.g., AND) will treat the same register content as an unsigned number (sequence of bits). Please go through mips.pdf to understand how each instruction treats its operands (signed or unsigned).

Sample Input/output Files

Your program will be given a text input file (see sample.txt). This file will contain a sequence of 32-bit instruction words starting at address ‚Äú260‚Äù. The final instruction in the sequence of instructions is always BREAK. There will be only one BREAK instruction. Following the BREAK instruction (immediately after BREAK), there is a sequence of 32-bit 2‚Äôs complement signed integers for the program data up to the end of the file. The newline character can be either ‚Äú ‚Äù (linux) or ‚Äú ‚Äù (windows). Your code should work for both cases. Please download the sample input/output files

using ‚ÄúSave As‚Äù instead of using copy/paste of the content.

Your MIPS simulator (with executable name as MIPSsim) should accept an input file (inputfilename.txt) in the following command format and produce two output files in the same directory: disassembly.txt (contains disassembled output) and simulation.txt (contains the simulation trace). Please hardcode the names of the output files. Please do not hardcode the input filename. It will be specified when running your program. For example, it can be ‚Äúsample.txt‚Äù or ‚Äútest.txt‚Äù.

MIPSsim inputfilename.txt

Correct handling of the sample input file (with possible different data values) will be used to determine 60% of the credit. The remaining 40% will be determined from other valid test cases that you will not have access prior to grading. It is recommended that you construct your own sample input files with which to further test your disassembler/simulator.

The disassembler output file should contain 3 columns of data with each column separated by one tab character (‚Äò ‚Äô or char(9)). See the sample disassembly file in the project1 assignment.

1. The text (e.g., 0‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs) string representing the 32-bit data word at that location.

2. The address (in decimal) of that location

3. The disassembled instruction.

Note, if you are displaying an instruction, the third column should contain every part of the instruction, with each argument separated by a comma and then a space (‚Äú, ‚Äù).

The simulation output file should have the following format.

20 hyphens and a new line

Cycle &lt; cycleNumber &gt;:&lt; tab &gt;&lt; instr_Address &gt;&lt; tab &gt;&lt; instr_string &gt;

&lt; blank_line &gt;

Registers

R00: &lt; tab &gt;&lt; int(R0) &gt;&lt; tab &gt;&lt; int(R1) &gt;‚Ä¶&lt; tab &gt;&lt; int(R7) &gt;

R08: &lt; tab &gt;&lt; int(R8) &gt;&lt; tab &gt;&lt; int(R9) &gt;‚Ä¶&lt; tab &gt;&lt; int(R15) &gt;

R16: &lt; tab &gt;&lt; int(R16) &gt;&lt; tab &gt;&lt; int(R17) &gt;‚Ä¶&lt; tab &gt;&lt; int(R23) &gt;

R24: &lt; tab &gt;&lt; int(R24) &gt;&lt; tab &gt;&lt; int(R25) &gt;‚Ä¶&lt; tab &gt;&lt; int(R31) &gt;

&lt; blank_line &gt;

Data

&lt; firstDataAddress &gt;: &lt; tab &gt;&lt; display 8 data words as integers with tabs in between &gt; ‚Ä¶.. &lt; continue until the last data word &gt;

The instructions and instruction arguments should be in capital letters. Display all integer values in decimal. Immediate values should be preceded by a ‚Äú#‚Äù symbol. Note that some instructions take signed immediate values while others take unsigned immediate values. You will have to make sure you properly display a signed or unsigned value depending on the context.

Because we will be using ‚Äúdiff ‚Äìw -B‚Äù to check your output versus the expected outputs, please follow the output formatting. Mismatches will be treated as wrong output and will lead to score penalty.

The project assignment contains the following sample programs/files to test your disassembler/simulator.

‚Ä¢ sample.txt : This is the input to your program.

‚Ä¢ sample_disassembly.txt : This is what your program should produce as disassembled output.

‚Ä¢ sample_simulation.txt : This is what your program should output as simulation trace.

Submission Policy:

Please follow the submission policy outlined below. There can be up to 10% score penalty based on the nature of submission policy violations.

1. Please develop your project in one source file. In other words, you cannot submit your project if you have designed it using multiple source files. Please add ‚Äú.txt‚Äù at the end of your filename. Your file name must be MIPSsim (e.g., MIPSsim.c.txt or MIPSsim.cpp.txt or MIPSsim.java.txt or MIPSsim.py.txt). On top of the source file, please include the sentence: ‚Äú/* On my honor, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this assignment */‚Äù.

2. Please test your submission. These are the exact steps we will follow too.

o Download your submission from eLearning (ensures your upload was successful).

o Please compile to produce an executable named MIPSsim.

‚ñ™ gcc MIPSsim.c ‚Äìo MIPSsim or javac MIPSsim.java or g++ -std=c++17 MIPSsim.cpp ‚Äìo MIPSsim

o Please do not print anything on screen.

o Please do not hardcode input filename, accept it as a command line option. You should hardcode your output filenames. Execution should always produce disassembly.txt and simulation.txt irrespective of the input filename.

o Execute to generate disassembly and simulation files and test with correct/provided ones

‚ñ™ ./MIPSsim inputfilename.txt or java MIPSsim inputfilename.txt or

./MIPSsim.py inputfilename.txt or python3 MIPSsim.py inputfilename.txt

‚ñ™ diff ‚Äìw ‚ÄìB disassembly.txt sample_disassembly.txt
